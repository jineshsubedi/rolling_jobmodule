Others have had to enrol further away from home, burdening their families with boarding or transportation&nbsp;costs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn spite of significant efforts to rebuild educational facilities, there are still major gaps in permanent school reconstruction, leaving children from the most underserved Districts behind. According to the Nepal Reconstruction Authority (NRA), Central-Level Project Implementation Unit of the Nepalese Ministry of Education (MoE-CLPIU), over 9,000 school buildings were affected and 7553 were damaged across the country due to devastating 2015 earthquake in Nepal. In total, 21,169 classrooms completely collapsed, 12,522 classrooms were severely damaged and 15,990 classrooms were damaged partially. As of December 2018, reconstruction of only 4172 schools has been achieved or ongoing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRealizing the contextual need in the education sector, the reconstruction of new 142 class rooms in 24 new school buildings is proposed with the aim to reach 5520 beneficiaries in remote earthquake-affected Districts of Nepal.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>The Project Scope</strong><br />\r\nThe scope of the construction works in each school is limited to;<br />\r\n1. Construction of a new classroom building of either 4, 6 or 8 classrooms.<br />\r\n2. Construction of a new toilet block<br />\r\n3. Securing the boundary of the school with a chain link fence and gate.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWithin this main scope, the requirement to address land stabilization (retaining walls), solar provision for lighting and small power, minor external works around the new proposed buildings have been included.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe are to construct these new schools in 4 Districts in Nepal as follows;<br />\r\n1. Ramechaap district - 13 schools<br />\r\n2. Sindhuli district - 9 schools<br />\r\n3. Kathmandu district - 1 special needs school<br />\r\n4. Bhaktapur district - 1 special needs school<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nFor each school site in Sindhuli and Ramechhap, the project shall be requiring a Field Supervisor to be stationed on site throughout the construction period.
